# Delta Disable
*Drupal Module*


### Provides a way to temporary disable field deltas without removing them.

Main settings form:
```
[site-root] /admin/structure/vm_delta_disable
```
After enabling the functionality for any entity, a checkbox will appear on every field that was selected for that entity. Checking it will cause the [field delta] to dissapear from entity view and drupal views.
